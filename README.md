# Project-with-image-processing-deep-learning
This project focuses on improving the quality of Breast Cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the application of image processing and machine learning techniques. I'm utilizing traditional image segmentation methods and exploring advanced deep learning approaches for image denoising and synthesis.
